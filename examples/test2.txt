what is cursorai?
As of my last update in October 2023, CursorAI is not a widely recognized or established term or product in the public domain. It’s possible that CursorAI could refer to a specialized or emerging technology, software, or tool that involves artificial intelligence (AI) in relation to cursor movements, user interfaces, or some other application.

If you have more specific context or details about CursorAI, I can provide more tailored information. It’s also worth checking the latest sources or official announcements if this is a very recent development.
