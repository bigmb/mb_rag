Sure, let's break it down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Write down the numbers vertically aligning by place value:**

   ```
     12
   + 17
   ```

2. **Add the digits in the rightmost column (ones place):**
   
   - The ones place digits are 2 and 7.
   - Add 2 + 7 = 9.
   
   Write down 9 in the ones place.

3. **Add the digits in the next column to the left (tens place):**
   
   - The tens place digits are 1 and 1.
   - Add 1 + 1 = 2.
   
   Write down 2 in the tens place.

4. **Combine the results:**

   Now you have the digits: 2 in the tens place and 9 in the ones place, which together make 29.

So, 12 + 17 equals 29.
