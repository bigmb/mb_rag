I am fine, what is AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. AI can be classified into two main types:

1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI):** This type of AI is designed to perform a narrow task (e.g., facial recognition, internet searches, or self-driving car technologies). It operates under a limited set of constraints and is not conscious or self-aware.

2. **General AI (Strong AI or AGI):** This type of AI would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence to solve any problem, much like a human being. AGI remains theoretical and has not yet been achieved.

AI technologies include machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), robotics, and computer vision, among others. AI applications are widespread and can be found in various industries, including healthcare, finance, education, and entertainment.
